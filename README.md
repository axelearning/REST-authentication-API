# Rest API: manage user authentication
Through this project I built a `REST API` to manage usersâ€™ authentication and permissions. Behind the scenes, the authorization system was implemented using the [JWT: Json Web Token] standard (https://jwt.io/introduction).  The API also includes:

- email verification upon account creation
- password reset via email
- permissions system that will depend on the user's status

## What did I learn?
- **Create a REST API,** using the`Django` framwork. 
- **Design a permissions system,** using the `Json Web Token (JWT)` standard.
- **Write clean code,** applying the methods learned in the book [Clean code](https://www.amazon.fr/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
- **Test driven development**

## Why this project?
Between November 2020 and June 2021 I co-funded a startup that aimed to simplify course creation and management for teachers. This API portion is one of the building blocks of this project: an educational platform for students and teachers.
