# PythonOOP 🐍

write clean object oriented code according to some key principles

- use understandable variable names
- create small classes with one responsability and strong cohesion
- built short function
- wrap external libraries to create our [own interfaces](helper/token.py)
- develop the infrastructure based on unit tests to facilitate code modification, maintenance and teamwork. More on that [here](../tests/tests_authentication)
- play on the good level of abstraction
